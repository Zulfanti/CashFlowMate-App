Most people face challenges in managing finances due to low financial literacy. Lack of knowledge often leads to poor decision making in budgeting and spending. As a result, individuals struggle to categorize their expenses efficiently, resulting in difficulty in assessing their personal financial situation. With this we want to implement the machine learning side to meet user needs and expectations, especially in terms of innovative user experience, comprehensive features, and optimal implementation of machine learning. As a result, the sustainability and effectiveness of using these financial applications remains a challenge, limiting their potential to provide maximum positive impact on users' financial literacy and financial management. Here are some of the research questions for our project based on this knowledge:

1. How can applications be implemented in financial to enhance their effectiveness in literacy and management?
2. How can an application effectively integrate features for recording daily, weekly, and monthly financial transactions to facilitate accurate budgeting and expense tracking?
